# Varun's Portfolio

## Projects:

### [Extracting Relationships Between Percy Jackson Characters](https://github.com/varuntandon04/Percy-Jackson-Relationship-Extraction)

#### This project comprises of two parts: Data collection via web scraping, and relationship extraction. The data is scraped with Selenuim and is then refined into a readable form after text preprocessing. The data is then converted into a edgelist dataframe, which can form a weighted graph. Using community detection, the graph is further divided into multiple sections, which is helpful for visualizations and analysis.

#### Some snapshots:

### [Feature Extraction From Music Genres](https://github.com/varuntandon04/Music-Genre-Feature-Extraction)

#### This project deals with audio data, specifically musical snippets, and how features can be extracted from it. The audio clips are preprocessed into a time series data type. These time series are converted into graphical visualizations that can provide meaningful information, called mel spectographs. Further, useful metrics such as rms values of the time series, spectral bandwith, and frequencies can be extracted from the data, which can then provide meaningful features converting this into a  classification problem.

### [Classification of Hepatitis C Categories](https://github.com/varuntandon04/Hepatitis-C-Data-Analysis)

#### This project is to showcase my skills in a classification problem, and how I approach fine tuning models. The primary goal was to perform multi-class classification on the Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/hepatitis-c-dataset). Multiple models were tested and compared.
#### Models used:
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* XGBoost

#### Metrics used:
* Accuracy

<!-- #### [Classification of Pokemon using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/varuntandon04/Pokemon_CNN_Classification)

### This project is to showcase my understanding of how Neural Networks operate and can be created from scratch. My goal was not to achieve near 100% accuracy, but rather see if a model I build is viable for the type of classification I'm performing and the type of [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thedagger/pokemon-generation-one) I'm using.
#### Model Used:
* A variation of VGG-16

#### Metrics used:
* Accuracy

### [Hotstar Predict The Segment](https://github.com/varuntandon04/Hotstar-Predict-The-Segment)

### This project was undertaken by my peers from RIT and I to classify whether a user of the streaming platform "Hotstar" would have a positive or a negitive sentiment towards the platform. The main goal of this project was to deal with data that was heavily imbalanced (2:23).

#### Models used:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* XGBoost

#### Metrics Used:
* AUC ROC
