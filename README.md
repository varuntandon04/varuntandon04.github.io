## Projects:

### [1. Classification of Hepatitis C Categories](https://github.com/varuntandon04/Hepatitis-C-Data-Analysis)

### This project is to showcase my skills in a classification problem, and how I approach fine tuning models. The primary goal was to perform multi-class classification on the Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/hepatitis-c-dataset). Multiple models were tested and compared.
#### Models used:
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* XGBoost

#### Metrics used:
* Accuracy

### [2. Classification of Pokemon using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/varuntandon04/Pokemon_CNN_Classification)

### This project is to showcase my understanding of how Neural Networks operate and can be created from scratch. My goal was not to achieve near 100% accuracy, but rather see if a model I build is viable for the type of classification I'm performing and the type of [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thedagger/pokemon-generation-one) I'm using.
#### Model Used:
* A variation of VGG-16

#### Metrics used:
* Accuracy

### [3. Hotstar Predict The Segment](https://github.com/varuntandon04/Hotstar-Predict-The-Segment)

### This project was undertaken by my peers from RIT and I to classify whether a user of the streaming platform "Hotstar" would have a positive or a negitive sentiment towards the platform. The main goal of this project was to deal with data that was heavily imbalanced (2:23).

#### Models used:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* XGBoost

#### Metrics Used:
* AUC ROC
